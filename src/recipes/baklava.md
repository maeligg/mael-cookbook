time: 60 min

ingredients:

  - 100g white sugar
  - 10 phyllo sheets

Grind all the nuts with the sugar. They should still have some texture, you don't want powder.

Melt the butter in a pan and pre-heat the oven at 200¬∞C.

In a large baking dish, put in one of the phyllo sheets, cover it with butter (ideally using a cooking brush), and repeat 4 more times. Distribute the nuts mixture evenly, then add the other 5 phyllo sheets (covering with butter between each one again). You can repeat this whole process a second time if you want extra-tall baklava and you still have enough nuts, but 1 layer already works fine.

Cut through the layered phyllo sheets in the shape of your choice (I like long diamonds). You should cut down to the bottom of the dish. Bake for 20 minutes.

In the meantime, prepare the syrup : heat up the honey with a little extra water and the cinnamon sticks. Traditional recipes also use orange blossom¬†water which is great if you have some at hand, but not required. Remove the cinnamon before serving.

When the baklava is cooked, immediately pour in the syrup, distributed evenly. It will look very liquid but don't worry : it will solidify as it cools down. You should wait until it's completely cold before eating.
